      />

      <h2>Precedence</h2>
      <p>
        Where policy for a given repo can live is one question; which layer wins when more than one
        is set is another. Most specific wins, in this order:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the repo&apos;s <code>.loopover.yml</code> (public repo config, or the mounted private
          per-repo config file below if <code>LOOPOVER_REPO_CONFIG_DIR</code> is set — the legacy{" "}
          <code>.gittensory.yml</code> name still works everywhere, indefinitely, #4773), then
        </li>
        <li>the per-repo database settings (the dashboard), then</li>
        <li>built-in safe defaults.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Within <code>.loopover.yml</code> itself, the typed <code>gate:</code> block is an alias for
        the gate-related fields and wins over the generic <code>settings:</code> block for those
        same fields — so a value written under both <code>gate.duplicates</code> and{" "}
        <code>settings.duplicates</code> resolves to whatever <code>gate.duplicates</code> says. One
        exception to the whole precedence chain: hard path guardrails (
        <code>settings.hardGuardrailGlobs</code>) are config-as-code only — a configured list ADDS
        repo-specific globs on top of a fixed set of built-in invariant guardrails (config-as-code
        files, CI workflows/scripts, and core engine-decision paths) that always apply and can never
        be disabled. Omitted or empty means only those built-in invariants hold, regardless of what
        the database row or defaults would otherwise imply.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page covers the environment layer and the shape of the config file. For the full field
        list — every <code>gate:</code> and <code>settings:</code> key, its default, and what it
        does — see <Link to="/docs/tuning">Tuning your reviews</Link>, and for copy-paste templates
        see the table below (also shipped inside the self-host image at{" "}
        <code>config/examples/</code>).
      </p>

      <h2>Config templates</h2>
      <p>
        Start from a template instead of reverse-engineering env flags, private-config precedence,
        and the parser. Every template uses the same schema for a public repo-root{" "}
        <code>.loopover.yml</code> (or the legacy <code>.gittensory.yml</code>, still fully
        supported, #4773) or a container-private <code>LOOPOVER_REPO_CONFIG_DIR</code> mount — only
        what you put in each file differs.

      <h2>Data paths</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>MIGRATIONS_DIR</code> (default <code>migrations</code>) — where the self-host
          runtime looks for SQL migration files to auto-apply at boot. Only relevant for a custom
          build that ships migrations somewhere other than the default in-image location.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>REVIEW_AUDIT_DIR</code> — when set, persists visual-review screenshot PNGs to this
          filesystem path so they're served from cache instead of re-rendered on every request.
          Unset means each screenshot is re-rendered on demand. Only relevant when{" "}
          <code>BROWSER_WS_ENDPOINT</code> (see{" "}
          <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-rees">REES enrichment</Link>) is also set — visual review is
          fully inert without it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>REVIEW_AUDIT_S3_BUCKET</code> / <code>_ENDPOINT</code> / <code>_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code>{" "}
          / <code>_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code> — an alternative to <code>REVIEW_AUDIT_DIR</code>:
          persist screenshots in an S3-compatible bucket (your own Cloudflare R2 bucket, or any
          other S3-compatible provider) instead of the local filesystem, and set{" "}
          <code>REVIEW_AUDIT_S3_PUBLIC_URL</code> to that bucket&rsquo;s own public base URL so
          screenshots link directly at the bucket instead of proxying through this instance. This
          matters if your instance sits behind a private network (a VPN, a firewall, no public DNS)
          — without a public bucket, screenshots embedded in a public PR comment are unreachable by
          GitHub and by anyone viewing the PR who isn&rsquo;t on that same private network. Takes
          priority over <code>REVIEW_AUDIT_DIR</code> when both are set.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>CODEX_HOME</code> — do not set this for the app container. The Codex provider
          rejects a container-set <code>CODEX_HOME</code> outright (fails closed with{" "}
          <code>codex_credential_isolation_required</code>) because <code>codex exec</code> reads
          attacker-controlled PR title/body/diff text, and a mounted OAuth home on the same
          filesystem could otherwise leak into review output via prompt injection. This is why the
          Codex subscription path additionally requires the explicit{" "}
          <code>LOOPOVER_ENABLE_UNSAFE_CODEX_REVIEWER=1</code> opt-in — see{" "}
          <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-ai-providers">AI providers</Link>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>GitHub API cache</h2>
      <p>
        Redis backs shared caching for stable GitHub GET responses, including repeated installation,
        repo/user metadata, and branch-protection required-status reads. Keys include the caller
        identity and response-shaping headers, and cold misses are single-flighted so concurrent
        jobs do not stampede GitHub.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        filename=".env"
        code={`GITHUB_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=20
GITHUB_BRANCH_PROTECTION_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=1200

      />
      <Callout variant="note">
        <code>GITHUB_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS</code> is the short default for repeated safe GitHub GETs.
        Stable repo/user metadata and branch-protection required-status reads use the per-class TTLs
        above so operators can keep repeated policy reads hot without broadening stale cache risk.
        Live CI status, check-run, check-suite, pull/issue subresources, pull mergeability, token
        minting, rate-limit, and collaborator-permission endpoints are never served from this cache.
        Prometheus exports <code>loopover_github_response_cache_total</code>, and the bundled
        self-host Grafana dashboard includes the hit/miss/coalesced/error breakdown.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Queue cadence and startup</h2>
      <p>
        <code>CRON_INTERVAL_MS</code> (default <code>120000</code>, ~2 minutes) is the tick that
        drives the maintain/sweep and sync cadence — contributor evidence, burden forecasts, RAG
        re-indexing, drift scans, and notifications all fan out from it.{" "}
        <code>QUEUE_BACKGROUND_CONCURRENCY</code> (default <code>1</code>) caps how many
        low-priority background jobs may occupy a <code>QUEUE_CONCURRENCY</code> slot at once,
        independent of live webhook/review work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>QUEUE_STARTUP_JITTER_MIN_JOBS</code> (default <code>8</code>) sets the pending-job
        count below which the queue skips its startup jitter delay — useful on a small instance
        where you'd rather a handful of jobs start processing immediately after boot than wait out a
        jitter window meant to stagger many instances restarting at once.
      </p>

      <h2>Maintenance and installation backpressure</h2>
      <p>
        Two independent, opt-out admission checks run at queue-claim time, on top of GitHub
        rate-limit deferral, so background work never starves live PR review or overloads the host.
        Both grew out of real production incidents — an un-jittered cron enqueue and an unbounded
        per-installation background fan-out — and every value below is optional with a sane default.

        if you register many repos or run a busy instance and see maintenance sweeps lagging behind
        where you'd like. A denial backs off by <code>MAINTENANCE_ADMISSION_DEFER_MS</code> (default{" "}
        <code>180000</code>, 3 minutes) before jitter, but two escape hatches stop a deferral from
        becoming a starve: <code>MAINTENANCE_ADMISSION_MAX_DEFER_AGE_MS</code> (default{" "}
        <code>14400000</code>, 4 hours) force-admits any maintenance job that has waited this long
        regardless of pressure, and the shorter <code>MAINTENANCE_ADMISSION_DRAIN_AGE_MS</code>{" "}
        (default <code>600000</code>, 10 minutes, clamped to the 4-hour ceiling) specifically drains
        the oldest jobs in a backed-up <code>maintenance_pending_high</code> lane so it can actually
        shrink instead of denying every claim for hours. Set{" "}
        <code>MAINTENANCE_ADMISSION_ENABLED=false</code> to fully disable the policy and return to
        the old always-run behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>GITHUB_INSTALLATION_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT</code> (default <code>2</code>) is the per-
        installation ceiling; <code>GITHUB_INSTALLATION_CONCURRENCY_DEFER_MS</code> (default{" "}
        <code>15000</code>, 15 seconds) is its base backoff before jitter. Raise the limit if a
        single large installation's background work is being throttled and you have GitHub
        rate-limit and host headroom to spare; set{" "}
        <code>GITHUB_INSTALLATION_CONCURRENCY_ENABLED=false</code> to disable the check entirely.
        This check only applies to background jobs that call GitHub — live PR review (
        <code>github-webhook</code>/<code>agent-regate-pr</code>) is never subject to it.
      </p>
      <Callout variant="note" title="FOREGROUND_LIVENESS_* — the other direction">
        Where the two backpressure checks above defer background work, foreground liveness protects
        live PR-review work FROM unbounded rate-limit deferral (its own worst case is up to ~65
        minutes per defer under sustained pressure, e.g. right after a deploy floods a shared REST
        budget). A periodic sweep force-releases any foreground-priority job that has genuinely
        waited past <code>FOREGROUND_LIVENESS_MAX_DEFER_MS</code> (default <code>600000</code>, 10
        minutes), checked every <code>FOREGROUND_LIVENESS_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS</code> (default{" "}
        <code>60000</code>, 1 minute — deliberately not the 1-second poll tick, so a job that is
        still genuinely rate-limited waits for the next sweep instead of busy-looping), releasing at
        most <code>FOREGROUND_LIVENESS_MAX_RELEASE_PER_SWEEP</code> jobs per tick (default{" "}
        <code>25</code>, oldest first, so a large inherited backlog ramps up gradually instead of
        every released job re-tripping the same rate-limit bucket at once). It also runs once at
        boot, so a restart self-heals inherited over-deferral. Set{" "}
        <code>FOREGROUND_LIVENESS_ENABLED=false</code> to disable the sweep.

      <h2>Tracing and telemetry env</h2>
      <p>
        <code>OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT</code> overrides the OpenTelemetry collector target only

        <code>http://otel-collector:4318</code> under the <code>observability</code> profile).{" "}
        <code>OTEL_SERVICE_NAME</code> (default <code>gittensory-selfhost</code>) is the service
        name traces and metrics are tagged with — set a distinct value per instance if you run more
        than one and want to tell them apart in Grafana/Tempo. <code>OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER</code>{" "}
        (default <code>parentbased_traceidratio</code>) picks the sampling strategy for app

        Most review capabilities need both their own flag and the repo in{" "}

        review. With only one of the two present, its contents are used as-is; with both present,
        they are deep-merged — the per-repo file overlaid onto the global default, nested mappings
        merging key by key and arrays replacing wholesale. The legacy <code>.gittensory.yml</code>{" "}

        operator has fully disabled at the deployment level); <code>false</code> forces it off for
        this repo regardless of the env flag; and omitting the key entirely falls back to the{" "}
        <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_REPOS</code> allowlist default, i.e. today's behavior for an operator

      <h2>Config-as-code blocks with no dashboard equivalent</h2>
      <p>
        Everything above has a dashboard row it mirrors. The fields below exist{" "}
        <strong>only</strong> in <code>.loopover.yml</code> (or the legacy{" "}
        <code>.gittensory.yml</code>, #4773) — there is no DB column or dashboard toggle for them,
        so a self-host operator who never reads the example file may not know they exist.

      <h3>gate.checkMode</h3>
      <p>
        Controls only whether/how the required <code>Gittensory Orb Review Agent</code> check-run is
        published — it never affects gate evaluation, comments, labels, audit records, or autonomous
        merge/close, all of which run identically in every mode. Takes precedence over the legacy{" "}

        Before switching to <code>disabled</code>, remove <code>Gittensory Orb Review Agent</code>{" "}
        from this repo&apos;s branch-protection or ruleset required-status-checks list — LoopOver
        cannot do this on your behalf, and leaving it required with nothing to satisfy it means
        GitHub shows a pending status forever. Keep your real CI/Codecov/security checks required;
        this setting only ever affects LoopOver&apos;s own check-run.
      </Callout>
      <p>
        For a repo that has never been configured, the default is <code>disabled</code>; an
        already-configured repo keeps its current effective behavior. Self-hosters running
        high-volume autonomous review should prefer <code>visible</code> or <code>disabled</code>{" "}
        over <code>required</code> — LoopOver&apos;s own merge/close decisions never depend on this

      <h3>Other gate-only fields</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>gate.cla</code> — sub-object for the CLA gate (<code>gate.claMode</code>, documented
          on <Link to="/docs/tuning">Tuning your reviews</Link>): <code>consentPhrase</code> (a
          case-insensitive substring LoopOver looks for in the PR description),{" "}
          <code>checkRunName</code> (an existing CLA-bot check-run name that also satisfies
          consent), and <code>checkRunAppSlug</code> (the trusted App slug required to have produced
          that check-run, so a contributor-controlled same-name check can&apos;t satisfy a blocking
          legal gate). Either detection method is enough; both may be set. All default to{" "}
          <code>null</code> (not configured).
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>gate.expectedCiContexts</code> — CI check/status context names to treat as required
          when GitHub branch protection returns no readable required-status-checks (unconfigured, or
          a 403 from a token lacking <code>administration:read</code> — common for GitHub App
          installations, especially self-host). Merged with branch-protection contexts when both are
          readable; used alone when branch protection is null/empty. Default: not configured, which
          keeps the fold-all fail-closed behavior when branch protection is also unreadable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>gate.premergeContentRecheck</code> — when <code>true</code>, a PR touching{" "}
          <code>migrations/**</code> gets a fresh GitHub read of the base branch&apos;s current
          migration filenames immediately before an agent-driven merge, catching a different PR that
          merged a same-numbered migration in the meantime. A live collision holds the PR instead of
          merging blind. Default <code>false</code> — costs one extra GitHub API call per
          migrations-touching PR.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>gate.requireFreshRebaseWindow</code> — when the base branch has advanced within this
          many minutes of the actual merge decision, forces an <code>update_branch</code> + fresh CI
          recheck before merging, instead of trusting a possibly-stale{" "}
          <code>mergeable_state: clean</code> read. A bounded retry cap prevents a fast-moving base
          from live-locking the PR. Default <code>null</code> (never force).
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>gate.dryRun</code> — when <code>true</code>, the posted check conclusion remains the
          real non-enforcing verdict while comments/check text may also show the would-be stricter
          verdict for AI-review blocker mode. It does not disable downstream merge/close planning
          for failures from already-enforced gates. Default <code>false</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>gate.firstTimeContributorGrace</code> — reserved and currently inert: parsed and
          stored, but the gate does not read it. A first-time contributor with a real blocker is
          one-shot closed the same as a repeat contributor. Kept for potential future use.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>settings.closeOwnerAuthors and blockedPaths</h3>
      <p>
        <code>settings.closeOwnerAuthors</code> — by default, the repo owner&apos;s own PRs (and{" "}
        <code>ADMIN_GITHUB_LOGINS</code> fleet-operator PRs) are never auto-closed; they may still
        auto-merge when clean and passing, or fall to a manual hold. Set <code>true</code> to make
        owner/admin-authored PRs eligible for auto-close like a contributor&apos;s, still gated by
        the close autonomy class and adverse-signal conditions. Automation-bot PRs stay exempt
        regardless of this setting. Default <code>false</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>blockedPaths</code> (top-level, alongside <code>wantedPaths</code>) is{" "}
        <strong>fully retired</strong> (#2974) — the FocusManifest parser no longer reads this key
        at all, it produces zero findings, and it is not enforceable under any{" "}
        <code>gate.manifestPolicy</code> mode. Setting it in a config produces only a migration
        warning from <code>npm run selfhost:config-lint</code>, nothing else.{" "}
        <strong>The only mechanism that actually holds a PR for a touched path</strong> is{" "}
        <code>settings.hardGuardrailGlobs</code> (config-as-code only, described above) — a
        would-merge PR that touches a configured guardrail glob is held for manual review.
      </p>

      <h3>settings anti-abuse block</h3>
      <p>
        A cluster of contributor-abuse guardrails, all config-as-code only, all off/unset by
        default:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Open-item caps</strong> — <code>contributorOpenPrCap</code> and{" "}
          <code>contributorOpenIssueCap</code> bound how many PRs/issues a single non-owner/
          non-admin/non-bot contributor may have open at once; a contributor&apos;s newest item
          above the cap is closed with a clear reason, their oldest items up to the cap stay open.
          Both are unset (no cap) by default. <code>contributorCapLabel</code> (default{" "}
          <code>over-contributor-limit</code>) is the label applied on close — set it to explicit{" "}
          <code>null</code> to close silently. <code>contributorCapCancelCi</code> cancels in-flight
          CI runs on a cap-triggered close (requires the <code>actions: write</code> App permission;
          degrades gracefully without it) and falls back to the{" "}
          <code>CONTRIBUTOR_CAP_CANCEL_CI_DEFAULT</code> env var when unset.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Review-nag cooldown</strong> — <code>reviewNagPolicy</code> (<code>off</code>/
          <code>hold</code>/<code>close</code>, default <code>off</code>) throttles a contributor
          who repeatedly pings <code>@gittensory</code> for review on the same PR/issue, once they
          exceed <code>reviewNagMaxPings</code> (default <code>3</code>) within{" "}
          <code>reviewNagCooldownDays</code> (default <code>5</code>). <code>reviewNagLabel</code>{" "}
          (default <code>review-nag-cooldown</code>) is applied alongside the hold/close action.{" "}
          <code>reviewNagMonitoredMentions</code> extends the same cooldown to specific maintainer
          logins a contributor keeps tagging directly instead of (or in addition to){" "}
          <code>@gittensory</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Exemptions and account age</strong> — <code>autoCloseExemptLogins</code> is a
          shared, repo-scoped list of logins never throttled or closed by these deterministic
          mechanisms, on top of the standing owner/admin/bot exemption.{" "}
          <code>accountAgeThresholdDays</code> (default <code>null</code>, off) applies{" "}
          <code>newAccountLabel</code> (default <code>new-account</code>) to a PR from a
          below-threshold-age account — friction/visibility only, never an automatic close on
          account age alone, and never for the owner, admins, or bots.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Command rate limit</strong> — <code>commandRateLimitPolicy</code> (
          <code>off</code>/<code>hold</code>, default <code>off</code>) generalizes the review-nag
          pattern to every <code>@gittensory</code> command, not just review-request pings.{" "}
          <code>commandRateLimitMaxPerWindow</code> (default <code>20</code>) bounds cheap,
          cache-only commands; <code>commandRateLimitAiMaxPerWindow</code> (default <code>5</code>)
          is the tighter limit for AI-cost-bearing commands (ask/blockers/preflight/etc.);{" "}
          <code>commandRateLimitWindowHours</code> (default <code>24</code>) is the rolling window
          both limits count against.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Lets a self-hosted maintainer point LoopOver at their own structured registry (a
        subnet/plugin/package catalog, for example) without a LoopOver code change — reviewing
        additions to a data file the same way it reviews code. Unconfigured by default; uncomment
        and set at least <code>entryFileGlob</code> and <code>collectionField</code> (both required
        — the whole block is ignored with a warning if either is missing).
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        filename=".loopover.yml"

      <h3>repoDocGeneration</h3>
      <p>
        Lets LoopOver open a pull request that refreshes this repo&apos;s own <code>AGENTS.md</code>
        /<code>CLAUDE.md</code> (and, additively, a skill file) on a schedule — never a direct
        commit. Disabled by default: an unconfigured repo, or an explicit{" "}

      <p>
        <code>SELFHOST_DEPLOYMENT_MODE</code> forces write suppression for the whole instance,
        regardless of per-repo autonomy — useful for running a self-host in parallel with the live
        cloud App on the same webhooks, provably posting nothing until an explicit cutover.
