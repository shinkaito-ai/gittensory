      <h2>Where REES fits</h2>
      <p>
        REES fires inside the AI review path. It is not a separate status check, dashboard report,
        or PR attachment. When it returns a non-empty <code>promptSection</code>, the engine folds
        that brief into the AI reviewer prompt. The final result is seen only through the normal AI
        review summary, blockers, risks, nits, and decision.
      </p>
      <Callout variant="note">
        A 200 response with no findings can produce no rendered brief. That is expected: the review
        proceeds as if REES had no useful extra context for that PR.
      </Callout>

      <h2>When it fires</h2>

            description:

            description:
              "LOOPOVER_REVIEW_ENRICHMENT must be truthy and REES_URL must be set. Otherwise no REES request is made.",

          },
        ]}
      />

      <h2>Run REES</h2>
      <p>
        REES runs as its own small HTTP service, separate from the engine. The simplest way to run
        it is in-network alongside the engine, using the docker-compose stack in the repo root — no
        separate hosting to manage, and nothing published to the host (the engine reaches it only
        over the compose network):
      </p>
      <CodeBlock lang="bash" code={`docker compose --profile rees up -d`} />
      <p>Point the engine at it and generate a fresh shared secret:</p>
      <CodeBlock
        filename=".env"
        code={`LOOPOVER_REVIEW_REPOS=owner/repo
LOOPOVER_REVIEW_ENRICHMENT=true
REES_URL=http://rees:8080
REES_SHARED_SECRET=<generate-a-new-shared-secret>`}
      />
      <p>
        No <code>SENTRY_*</code> variables are required for a working local REES. Set them only if
        you want REES error reporting — see "Service configuration" below for the variables REES
        reads, and add them for the <code>rees</code> service through a{" "}
        <code>docker-compose.override.yml</code> rather than the root <code>.env</code>: REES reads
        the same <code>SENTRY_DSN</code> name the main engine uses, so forwarding the whole{" "}
        <code>.env</code> file would point REES's error reporting at the engine's Sentry project
        instead of a dedicated one.
      </p>

      <h3>Pointing at an external or managed instance instead</h3>
      <p>
        If you'd rather run REES elsewhere — a separate host, a managed provider, or one shared
        instance across multiple self-hosted installs — point <code>REES_URL</code> at it directly
        and skip the <code>rees</code> compose profile entirely. Generate a dedicated shared secret
        for that instance; never reuse a secret across two different REES instances you run:
      </p>

      />

      <h2>Disable cleanly</h2>
      <p>
        Set <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_ENRICHMENT=false</code> to turn off REES for the whole instance.
        To keep REES configured but prevent a repo from using it, remove that repo from{" "}
        <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_REPOS</code>. Token forwarding stays off unless you explicitly set{" "}
        <code>REES_FORWARD_GITHUB_TOKEN=true</code>.

LOOPOVER_REVIEW_ENRICHMENT=false

# Keep REES on and explicitly allow token-aware analyzers:
REES_FORWARD_GITHUB_TOKEN=true`}
      />

      <h2>Analyzer selection</h2>
      <p>
        Leave <code>REES_ANALYZERS</code> unset, <code>all</code>, or <code>*</code> to use the
        selected <code>REES_PROFILE</code> defaults. To run a subset, use exact comma-separated
        analyzer names. Unknown names are ignored with a <code>rees_analyzer_config_invalid</code>{" "}
        warning and the remaining valid analyzers still run. If every configured name is invalid,
        the engine sends an empty analyzer list so the typo fails closed instead of running the full
        registry.

        analyzer's inputs, network behavior, and finding shape.
      </p>

      <h2>Request boundary</h2>
      <p>
        When enabled, the engine POSTs the repo name, PR number, head SHA, base SHA when GitHub
        supplies it, title, changed file paths, changed file patches, and review diff to{" "}
        <code>REES_URL</code>. It forwards no GitHub token by default. If{" "}
        <code>REES_FORWARD_GITHUB_TOKEN=true</code>, the engine includes a GitHub read token so
        GitHub API analyzers can read private CODEOWNERS and blob sizes. The engine prefers a
        short-lived installation token and falls back to <code>GITHUB_PUBLIC_TOKEN</code>. Enable
        forwarding only when the REES service is inside your trust boundary.
      </p>
      <Callout variant="safety">
        Do not point <code>REES_URL</code> at a service you do not trust with PR diffs. Token
        forwarding is optional, but the diff/files themselves can contain private code.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Service configuration</h2>
      <p>
        The REES service must use the matching <code>REES_SHARED_SECRET</code>. Optional Sentry env
        captures analyzer degradations without logging request bodies, tokens, diffs, or review
        content.
