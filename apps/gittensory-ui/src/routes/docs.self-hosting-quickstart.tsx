      <h2>1. Copy the sample env</h2>
      <p>
        <code>.env.selfhost.example</code> is the short path: required secrets plus a conservative
        first-boot config, with nothing about the Cloudflare Worker deploy. Copy it and fill in the
        placeholders — keep your real <code>.env</code> out of git and prefer mounted secret files
        for multiline values like the GitHub App private key.
      </p>

        lang="bash"
        code={`cp .env.selfhost.example .env
# edit .env`}

      <Callout variant="warn">
        The webhook secret and static bearer tokens (<code>GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET</code>,{" "}

        <code>INTERNAL_JOB_TOKEN</code>, <code>SELFHOST_SETUP_TOKEN</code>) ship commented out on
        purpose. Generate a distinct random value for each one (e.g.{" "}
        <code>openssl rand -hex 32</code>) — never reuse the same string across more than one of
        them. The app refuses to boot if any of these is left at a known-placeholder or too-short
        value.
      </Callout>
      <Callout variant="note">
        <code>.env.selfhost.example</code> already ships a conservative starting config —{" "}
        <code>dry-run</code> mode, a small repo allowlist, unified comments, safety, and grounding,
        with AI, RAG, and REES left off. Switch to live only after webhook delivery, logs, and

      <h2>2. Choose your AI provider (optional)</h2>
      <p>
        Skip this step for a fully deterministic review (no AI). Otherwise set{" "}
        <code>AI_PROVIDER</code> to one provider or a fallback chain. The self-host image bundles
        both CLIs by default; credentials and provider choice are runtime-only.

        Codex stores its OAuth credential in <code>auth.json</code> on the same filesystem that

      <h2>3. Boot the stack</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Recommended: pull the published image.</strong> No local build, no Node toolchain —
        the script pulls, restarts, and waits for the health check to pass.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"
        code={`./scripts/deploy-selfhost-image.sh
curl http://localhost:8787/health
curl http://localhost:8787/ready`}
      />
      <p>
        Pin a specific release instead of <code>:latest</code>, or point at your own registry:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"
        code={`./scripts/deploy-selfhost-image.sh ghcr.io/jsonbored/loopover-selfhost:orb-v0.1.0
GITTENSORY_IMAGE=ghcr.io/jsonbored/loopover-selfhost@sha256:... ./scripts/deploy-selfhost-image.sh`}
      />
      <p>
        <code>ghcr.io/jsonbored/gittensory-selfhost</code> (the pre-rename name) remains available
        as a deprecated alias of the identical image during the deprecation window — existing pins
        keep working unmodified.
      </p>
      <Callout variant="note" title="Building from source instead">
        Contributors and anyone customizing the Dockerfile can still build locally —{" "}
        <code>docker compose up -d --build</code> builds the <code>gittensory</code> service from
        the checkout instead of pulling a published image. Everything else in this quickstart (env,
        health checks, GitHub App) is identical either way. Two build-args trim the image:{" "}
        <code>--build-arg INSTALL_AI_CLIS=false</code> skips the Claude Code/Codex CLIs (default{" "}
        <code>true</code>), and <code>--build-arg INSTALL_VISUAL_REVIEW=true</code> adds{" "}
        <code>puppeteer-core</code> for visual capture (default <code>false</code> — needs a{" "}
        <code>BROWSER_WS_ENDPOINT</code> at runtime).
      </Callout>

      />

      <h2>4. Install or connect the GitHub App</h2>
      <p>
        Point your App webhook to <code>https://your-host.example/v1/github/webhook</code>, set the
        same webhook secret in <code>GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET</code>, install the App on one test repo,
        and open a small PR. The direct App and Orb modes are covered in{" "}
        <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-github-app">GitHub App and Orb</Link>.
      </p>
      <Callout variant="note">
        Set <code>ADMIN_GITHUB_LOGINS</code> to a comma/whitespace-separated list of GitHub logins
        before signing in to the control panel — it's the only allowlist for the operator role
        (operator dashboard, drift status). No login is authorized as operator without it.
      </Callout>

      <h2>5. Watch the first review</h2>
      <p>Look for these logs during boot and the first webhook:</p>
      <CodeBlock
        code={`selfhost_listening
selfhost_migrations_applied
selfhost_ai_provider          # only when AI_PROVIDER is set
selfhost_job_dead             # investigate immediately if present
review_context_fetch_failed   # REES/RAG/grounding context failure`}
      />
      <p>
        A cold first boot on SQLite commonly logs a one-time{" "}
        <code>selfhost_migrations_applied</code> burst and a brief Redis connection retry while the
        sidecar finishes starting — both are expected and stop once the stack is warm. Anything else
        that looks wrong, or a <code>/ready</code> that stays unhealthy past a couple minutes, is
        covered in <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</Link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the deterministic path is stable, continue with{" "}
        <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-configuration">Configuration</Link> and then layer in AI, REES,
        or RAG deliberately.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Activate your first repo</h2>
      <p>
        Three separate knobs are easy to conflate — each does something different, and all three
        matter for a smooth first rollout:

        <strong>Recommended first-repo path today:</strong> add the repo to{" "}

      />
      <p>
        Sign in to the control panel (<code>ADMIN_GITHUB_LOGINS</code> must include your GitHub
