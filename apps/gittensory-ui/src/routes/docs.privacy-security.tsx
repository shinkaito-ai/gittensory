    >
      <h2>Hard rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No source upload by default. MCP sends metadata only.</li>
        <li>No PAT storage. Auth uses GitHub Device Flow.</li>
        <li>No wallet or hotkey display.</li>
        <li>No raw trust-score display.</li>
        <li>No payout/reward guarantees, anywhere.</li>
        <li>No farming language.</li>
        <li>No public score estimates.</li>
        <li>No private reviewability details in public GitHub output.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Open algorithm, private tuning</h2>
      <p>
        LoopOver's review engine is built so the{" "}
        <strong>logic is public but the dial settings are not</strong>. The deterministic gate, the
        scoring signals, the slop detector, the grounding/RAG context builders, and the comment
        renderer all live in the open source tree — anyone can read exactly how a verdict is
        reached. What stays private is the <strong>production tuning</strong>: the thresholds,
        guardrail paths, and gate modes an operator runs in production. That separation is what
        keeps a review from being gameable off the public code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tuning lives in two private, repo-scoped places that sit on top of the open algorithm, and
        neither reveals review <em>direction</em>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Per-repo settings</strong> — gate modes, score thresholds, and guardrails, stored
          in the operator's database (set through the dashboard/API) or declared as config-as-code
          in a repo's <code>.loopover.yml</code> (or legacy <code>.gittensory.yml</code>, #4773).
          Choosing <code>gate.slop.minScore</code> or setting{" "}
          <code>settings.hardGuardrailGlobs</code> tightens the gate without telling a contributor
          how to bypass it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Operator feature flags</strong> — the <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_*</code> family of
          worker environment variables. These switch whole capabilities (safety scanning, CI and
          full-file grounding, RAG context, reputation-based spend control, the unified comment) on
          or off for a deployment.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Every feature flag ships <strong>OFF</strong>, and a per-PR capability runs only when its
        own flag is on <em>and</em> the repo is in the <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_REPOS</code> allowlist
        — so capabilities stay dormant until an operator explicitly converges a repo, one flag and
        one repo at a time.

      <p>
        The internal-only controls never surface publicly. Submitter reputation, for example, can
        downgrade a burst or low-reputation submitter to a deterministic-only review — but no
        comment, label, or check ever shows a reputation value. Reputation thresholds are generic
        anti-abuse defaults that reveal no review direction and are not per-repo tunable.
