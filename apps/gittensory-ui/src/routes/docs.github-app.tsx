    >
      <p>
        Once installed, a <strong>LoopOver GitHub App reviews every pull request</strong> on the
        repos you select. Self-hosting your own App (see{" "}
        <Link to="/docs/maintainer-self-hosting">self-hosting setup</Link>) is the only currently
        available path. Each review produces two surfaces: the{" "}
        <strong>Gittensory Orb Review Agent</strong> check run (and the advisory{" "}
        <strong>Gittensory Context</strong> check), and a single review comment posted by{" "}
        <code>gittensory[bot]</code> that updates in place as the PR evolves. The review behavior
        below this page's Install section (PR panel, checks, gate modes, config-as-code) is the same
        regardless of which connection mode your self-hosted App uses.
      </p>

      <h2>Install</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Self-hosting is the only currently available path.</strong> Run the review stack
        yourself, then install your own GitHub App on exactly the repos you choose using the
        self-host setup wizard. The direct App's required permissions and events are covered in{" "}
        <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-github-app">GitHub App and Orb</Link> — use that page's
        checklist for a self-hosted install.
      </p>
      <Callout variant="note" title="Shared, centrally hosted App: not currently available">
        LoopOver previously ran a private managed-beta shared App that repo owners could install
        directly, without self-hosting. That shared install path is currently paused while
        self-hosted Orb is the primary way to run LoopOver — a new centrally hosted offering is
        planned for the future. If you previously used the shared managed-beta App, see{" "}

          Leave <strong>Gittensory Context</strong> advisory while you tune copy and settings. Make{" "}
          <strong>Gittensory Orb Review Agent</strong> required only after the repo explicitly
          enables blocking rules.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Default posture</h2>
      <p>
        LoopOver is advisory-first. Public comments, labels, the Context check, and the review-agent
        check are controlled per repo. Missing issue links, non-Gittensor contributors, busy queues,
        and weak overlap signals do not block merge by default.
      </p>

      <h2>PR panel</h2>
      <p>
        The PR panel is the review comment the LoopOver app posts on each pull request. It is one
        sticky comment authored by <code>gittensory[bot]</code> that updates in place — the app
        edits the same comment instead of adding new ones. It shows a public-safe readiness score,
        concrete signal evidence, and short actions for linked issues, related work, review load,
        validation evidence, open PR queue, contributor context, and Gate result.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default the comment is posted only to detected contributors (<code>commentMode</code> is{" "}
        <code>detected_contributors_only</code>). Set <code>commentMode</code> to{" "}
        <code>all_prs</code> to comment on every PR, or <code>off</code> to suppress the comment
        entirely. Operators who have rolled the deployment onto the unified review comment (see
        below) get the single in-place comment shape; otherwise the legacy multi-panel comment is
        used unchanged.
      </p>

      <h2>Checks</h2>
      <p>
        The LoopOver app publishes its review as check runs.{" "}
        <strong>Gittensory Orb Review Agent</strong> is the gate result, controlled by{" "}
        <code>reviewCheckMode</code> (<code>required</code> / <code>visible</code> /{" "}
        <code>disabled</code>). <strong>Gittensory Context</strong> is the separate advisory
        companion, controlled by its own <code>checkRunMode</code> (<code>off</code> /{" "}
        <code>enabled</code>) — these two switches are independent axes, not one setting for both
        checks. <code>checkRunDetailLevel</code> (<code>minimal</code> / <code>standard</code>) only
        affects <strong>Gittensory Context</strong>'s output depth; it has no effect on the Orb
        Review Agent check.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Gittensory Context</strong> is advisory and should not be required in branch
        protection. <strong>Gittensory Orb Review Agent</strong> is opt-in and can be made required
        after a repo owner chooses blocking rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Branch protection should require <strong>Gittensory Orb Review Agent</strong> only after the
        repo has verified installation health, previewed the public panel, and configured at least
        one <code>block</code> rule. Do not require <strong>Gittensory Context</strong>; it is there
        to inform reviewers, not stop merges.
      </p>

      <h2>Gate modes</h2>
      <p>
        The deterministic gate is the heart of the LoopOver review. Its master switch is{" "}
        <code>reviewCheckMode</code> (<code>required</code> / <code>visible</code> /{" "}
        <code>disabled</code>); each dimension then refines an already-enabled gate with a tri-state
        mode — <code>off</code> (not evaluated), <code>advisory</code> (surfaced, never blocks), or{" "}
        <code>block</code> (can become a hard <strong>Gittensory Orb Review Agent</strong> blocker).
        A configured blocker fails the gate for any author identically —
        confirmed-Gittensor-contributor status does not change <em>who</em> can be blocked; it's
        carried through only for on-chain scoring, a separate concern from the gate's own
        merge/close decision.
      </p>

          defect become a blocker.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>sizeGateMode</code> — PR-size hold. Default <code>off</code>; a PR at or above the
          configured file/line thresholds is held for manual review rather than auto-merged, never a
          hard failure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>lockfileIntegrityGateMode</code> — lockfile-tamper-risk check (a resolved/integrity
          change with no matching version bump, or a dependency pointed off the npm registry).
          Default <code>off</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>claGateMode</code> — CLA / license-compatibility gate. Default <code>off</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
          <code>linkedIssueSatisfactionGateMode</code> — an AI assessment of whether the PR's diff
          actually satisfies its primary linked issue's intent, distinct from{" "}
          <code>linkedIssueGateMode</code> (which only checks a link exists). Default{" "}
          <code>off</code>; <code>advisory</code> renders in the review comment without blocking,{" "}
          <code>block</code> additionally lets a confidence-floor-passing "unaddressed" verdict
          become a blocker.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>moderationGateMode</code> — whether the moderation-rules engine (contributor cap,
          blacklist, review-nag feeding a shared cross-repo violation tally) runs on this repo.
          Default <code>inherit</code> (defers to the instance-wide default); <code>off</code>/
          <code>enabled</code> force it per repo.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The policy pack (<code>gatePack</code>) selects which rule set runs: <code>gittensor</code>{" "}
        (registry-aware, tracks confirmed-Gittensor-contributor status for scoring) or{" "}
        <code>oss-anti-slop</code> (the deterministic rules against any author on any repo, with no
        confirmed-contributor tracking at all).

        &gt; safe defaults; an unset field falls back to the next layer. It only chooses{" "}

      <h2>
        Review capability flags (<code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_*</code>)
      </h2>
      <p>
        Beyond per-repo settings, operators turn whole review <em>capabilities</em> on or off with
        the <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_*</code> worker environment variables. Every flag defaults to{" "}
        <strong>OFF</strong>: when a flag is off its code path is inert and the review behaves
        exactly as if the feature did not exist. "Truthy" is one of <code>1</code>,{" "}
        <code>true</code>, <code>yes</code>, or <code>on</code>. You roll capabilities forward — and
        back — one flag, and one repo, at a time.
      </p>
      <Callout variant="safety">
        Per-PR features require <strong>two</strong> conditions: the capability flag is on{" "}
        <em>and</em> the repo is listed in <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_REPOS</code>. With an empty repo
        allowlist every per-PR feature stays dormant for everyone, no matter the global flags.
      </Callout>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_REPOS</code> — per-repo cutover allowlist. Comma-separated{" "}
          <code>owner/repo</code> names that may run the per-PR features. Add repos one at a time to
          roll forward; remove to roll back.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_SAFETY</code> — safety scan: defangs untrusted PR title/body/diff
          (prompt-injection neutralization) before the reviewer sees it, and surfaces a{" "}
          <code>secret_leak</code> blocker for leaked secrets in the diff. Per-PR.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_GROUNDING</code> — grounds the AI reviewer with the PR's finished CI
          status and the full post-change content of the changed files, so the model verifies its
          claims against reality. Per-PR.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_RAG</code> — retrieval-augmented context: appends semantically
          related code/docs from the codebase vector index to the reviewer prompt. Per-PR; inert
          until a <code>VECTORIZE</code> index exists for the repo.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_REPUTATION</code> — submitter-reputation spend control: downgrades a
          new / burst / low-reputation submitter to a deterministic-only review. Internal-only,
          never surfaced publicly. Per-PR.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_UNIFIED_COMMENT</code> — renders the public PR comment as one
          in-place unified comment instead of the legacy multi-panel comment. Per-PR; flag-off keeps
          the legacy comment byte-identical.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_OPS</code> — read-only observability: a cron anomaly scan over your
          own review-outcome data plus a bearer-gated stats aggregate. Global (not scoped by the
          repo allowlist).
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_SELFTUNE</code> — self-improvement loop that computes tuning
          recommendations from review outcomes, shadow-soaks any strictly-tightening recommendation,
          and can <em>only ever tighten</em> the gate. Global.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_CONTENT_LANE</code> — routes content repos (curated lists,
          registries) through the dedicated content lane instead of the code gate. Global.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_DRAFT</code> — public draft-submission flow (contributor draft →
          GitHub OAuth → fork PR). Global; also needs the draft secrets set.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A safe rollout for a per-PR feature is two flips: set the capability flag truthy, then add
        the repo to <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_REPOS</code>. Because both must hold, a capability can
        stay globally enabled while remaining dormant everywhere except the repos you have
        explicitly added.
