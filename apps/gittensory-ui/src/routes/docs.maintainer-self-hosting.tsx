      <p>
        Self-hosting is a major product path, not a single install command. The service can run as a
        quiet advisory reviewer, a private maintainer copilot, or a full review operator. The docs
        are split by operating concern so you can onboard gradually.

      <p>
        This section records today&apos;s accurate setup path and the gaps worth closing next — the
        issue deliverable for making self-host onboarding as fast as CodeRabbit while keeping robust
        per-repo policy in container-private config.

      <h3>Today&apos;s recommended path (verified)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <code>cp .env.selfhost.example .env</code> — conservative defaults (<code>dry-run</code>,
          small <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_REPOS</code>).

        <li>
          Pull or build the image (<code>INSTALL_AI_CLIS=true</code> by default;{" "}
          <code>--build-arg INSTALL_AI_CLIS=false</code> for deterministic-only).
        </li>
        <li>
          One-click GitHub App via <code>/setup</code> + <code>SELFHOST_SETUP_TOKEN</code> (
          <code>Checks: write</code> included — re-approve on existing Apps after permission bumps).

          <code>gittensory-config/.loopover.yml</code> (the legacy{" "}
          <code>gittensory-config/.gittensory.yml</code> name still works too, #4773) for a
          centralized private default (per-repo files deep-merge on top).
        </li>
        <li>
          Add each pilot repo to <code>LOOPOVER_REVIEW_REPOS</code>, watch a PR in{" "}

      </Callout>

      <h2>How self-hosting fits with hosted docs</h2>
      <p>
        The hosted maintainer workflow still applies: review modes, gate settings, safety rules, and
        privacy boundaries are the same concepts. Self-hosting adds infrastructure choices,
        deployment secrets, private config, and local operating responsibility. Use{" "}
        <Link to="/docs/tuning">Tuning your reviews</Link> for gate semantics and this section for
        running the service yourself.
      </p>

      <h2>Moving a repo between hosted and self-host</h2>
      <Callout variant="note" title="Hosted is currently paused">
        &quot;Hosted&quot; here means the private managed-beta shared <code>gittensory</code> App
        described in <Link to="/docs/github-app">GitHub App configuration</Link> — it previously
        accepted new installs and is currently paused while self-hosted Orb is the primary way to
        run LoopOver. A new centrally hosted offering is planned for the future. "Switching from
        hosted to self-host" below still applies to any repo already installed on the hosted App;
        "switching back to hosted" isn't possible until hosted installs reopen, but the steps are
        kept here for when they do.
      </Callout>
      <p>
        A repo installed on the hosted App is reviewed by LoopOver&apos;s own cloud Worker and its
        own database. &quot;Self-host&quot; means your own container from{" "}
        <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-quickstart">Quickstart</Link>, with its own GitHub App (or
        brokered Orb enrollment) and its own data store. There is{" "}
        <strong>no automated migration path between the two</strong> — moving a repo is a manual App
        swap plus re-creating whatever settings you had, not a toggle.
      </p>

      <h3>Switching a repo from hosted to self-host</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Stand up your self-host instance first and confirm <code>/ready</code> is healthy — see{" "}
          <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-quickstart">Quickstart</Link> — before touching the hosted
          install, so the repo is never briefly reviewed by nothing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create <strong>your own</strong> GitHub App via the self-host{" "}
          <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-github-app">setup wizard</Link> (or brokered Orb enrollment).
          You cannot repoint the existing shared hosted App at your self-host container — the shared
          App&apos;s credentials belong to LoopOver&apos;s cloud Worker, and{" "}
          <code>src/selfhost/setup-wizard.ts</code> always mints a distinct App tied to your
          instance&apos;s own webhook URL.
        </li>
        <li>
          Install your new self-host App on the repo, choosing only that repo (or the org, if you're
          migrating several at once).
        </li>
        <li>
          Uninstall the shared hosted App from that repo (repo Settings → Integrations → GitHub Apps
          → gittensory → Uninstall, or the equivalent org-level App settings page) once you&apos;ve
          confirmed the self-host App is reviewing PRs correctly. Leaving both installed means two
          reviewers post competing checks and comments on the same PRs.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What does not carry over automatically</h3>
      <p>
        Hosted-side settings live in LoopOver&apos;s own cloud database, keyed by repo full name —{" "}
        <code>resolveRepositorySettings</code> (<code>src/settings/repository-settings.ts</code>)
        reads them from <code>env.DB</code>, which is a completely different database instance than
        your self-host container&apos;s. A self-host instance has no access to, and no import path
        for, whatever thresholds, gate modes, or review-mode settings you configured on the hosted
        side through the control panel or API. If you want the same behavior, you have to
        re-configure it on the new instance from scratch — there is no export/import tool for this
        today.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          One thing genuinely does carry over: a repo&apos;s own <code>.loopover.yml</code> (or
          legacy <code>.gittensory.yml</code>, #4773)
        </strong>{" "}
        (config-as-code), because it lives in the repository&apos;s git history, not in either
        service&apos;s database. <code>resolveRepositorySettings</code> overlays it on top of
        whatever DB settings exist, on either hosted or self-host — so gate-mode overrides,
        thresholds, and other settings expressed in that file apply identically the moment the new
        App starts reviewing, with nothing to re-enter.
      </p>
      <Callout variant="warn" title="Review history does not move">
        Past review comments, check-run history, and any per-PR state LoopOver recorded while the
        hosted App was active stay wherever they were created — GitHub comments and check runs are
        never deleted or copied by an uninstall/install, but nothing in the self-host database is
        backfilled from the hosted side. A migrated repo starts its self-host review history from
        zero.
      </Callout>
      <p>
        What stays identical for contributors either way: the review still posts as a{" "}
        <code>gittensory[bot]</code>-style comment (under your own App&apos;s slug once you migrate,
        not literally <code>gittensory[bot]</code>) plus the same check-run shape, and the gate
        semantics in <Link to="/docs/tuning">Tuning your reviews</Link> and{" "}
        <Link to="/docs/how-reviews-work">How reviews work</Link> are unchanged — only the
        infrastructure and the settings storage location differ.
      </p>

      <h3>Switching a repo from self-host back to hosted</h3>
      <p>
        Hosted installs are currently paused — this direction isn't possible until the shared App
        reopens (see the callout above). Once it does, the reverse migration has the same shape and
        the same gap: uninstall your self-host App from the repo, install the shared hosted App (see{" "}
        <Link to="/docs/github-app">GitHub App configuration</Link>), and re-create any DB-backed
        settings on the hosted side. <code>.loopover.yml</code> (or legacy{" "}
        <code>.gittensory.yml</code>, #4773) again carries over for free since it travels with the
        repo; nothing else does. Your self-host instance&apos;s data volumes are untouched by this —
        see <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-operations">Uninstalling and decommissioning</Link> if you
        also intend to shut the instance down rather than keep it idle or reuse it for other repos.
