// Container-private per-repo config (self-host). A self-host operator mounts a directory at
// LOOPOVER_REPO_CONFIG_DIR and configures each repo's review policy there; the focus-manifest loader reads it
// INSTEAD of fetching the public `.gittensory.yml`/`.loopover.yml`, so policy (gate, autonomy, labels, model/effort)
// is configured PRIVATELY and never exposed to contributors who could read and game the public file. Node-only — it
// is registered into the Workers-safe loader via setLocalManifestReader at boot (server.ts), so this module's fs
// import never reaches the Cloudflare bundle.
//
// Layout (CodeRabbit-style: per-repo override, layered over a global default, layered over a cross-repo shared
// base — #1959). For a repo `JSONbored/gittensory` the reader tries, in priority order:
//   1. `jsonbored__gittensory/.loopover.yml`    — owner-qualified folder (robust to repo-name collisions across owners)
//   2. `gittensory/.loopover.yml`               — bare repo-name folder (the clean, human-readable layout)
//   3. `jsonbored__gittensory.yml`              — flat owner__repo file (the original #1390 layout; back-compat)
//   4. `.loopover.yml`                          — GLOBAL default at the dir root, shared by every repo.
//   5. `_shared/.loopover.yml`                  — SHARED BASE (#1959), the lowest-priority layer: one house policy
//      an operator running many repos writes once instead of copy-pasting into every repo's private config.
// `.yaml` / `.json` are accepted everywhere `.yml` is, and `.gittensory.*` (the pre-rebrand name) is accepted
// everywhere `.loopover.*` is (#4773 — dual-read, additive only, indefinitely: an existing self-hoster's committed
// `.gittensory.*` file keeps working with zero changes on their part). CONFIG_BASENAMES below lists every accepted
// basename with the new-brand `.loopover.*` entries FIRST and the legacy `.gittensory.*` entries LAST; `readFirstExisting`
// (and its `WithPath` sibling) return the first candidate that exists, in list order, so within any single location
// (a given folder, or the dir root) a `.loopover.*` file present there is read and an old `.gittensory.*` file
// sitting alongside it is ignored (not merged) — see CONFIG_BASENAMES for why new-brand-first is the right
// precedence. An operator who has done nothing keeps working unchanged: only `.gittensory.*` exists anywhere, so it
// is still the first (and only) hit at every location. With only ONE of {a per-repo candidate, the global default,
// the shared base} present, its raw text is returned unchanged — byte-identical to the original #1390 behavior
// (and to the pre-#1959 2-layer behavior when no shared base is mounted, the common case). With more than one
// present, they are DEEP-MERGED in ascending priority (shared base → global default → per-repo file): nested
// mappings (`gate`, `settings`, `review`, `features`, `contentLane`, and their own nested blocks) merge key by key,
// arrays replace wholesale (never concatenated), and an explicit YAML/JSON `null` at a key always overrides a
// lower layer's value there — which clears a setting wherever the manifest parser already treats an explicit null
// as "off"/"clear" (e.g. `settings.contributorOpenPrCap`, `settings.accountAgeThresholdDays`), and is otherwise
// equivalent to omitting the key. A key that is simply absent from a higher layer leaves the lower layer's value at
// that key untouched. If a layer fails to parse as a YAML/JSON mapping (or is oversized), it is dropped from the
// fold and the remaining, still-valid layers merge as if it were never mounted — a broken layer never discards a
// still-good sibling's policy, and never blocks a review. If NONE of the present layers parse, the highest-priority
// present layer's raw text is returned (matching the original single-candidate priority), so a doubly/triply broken
// set degrades exactly like a single malformed manifest always has. The slug is lowercased (GitHub repo full-names
// are case-insensitive; #1390 already lowercased).
//
// The reserved shared-base folder `_shared` is never treated as a bare repo-name config folder for a real GitHub
// repo named `_shared`; use the owner-qualified or flat owner__repo candidates for that repository instead.
