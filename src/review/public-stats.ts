// Public "proof of power" stats (#1059) — a small, public-safe aggregate of what gittensory's REVIEW SYSTEM has
// done, powering the above-the-fold homepage counter. Flag-gated by GITTENSORY_PUBLIC_STATS (default OFF): when
// off the public endpoint 404s, so the deploy is byte-identical to today until the flag is deliberately set.
//
// REALTIME: queries the live ledger directly (no rollup/cron) so a new review shows up within the 60s HTTP cache
// window. "reviewed" = a distinct PR for which the review system published a public review surface (audit_events
// `github_app.pr_public_surface_published`, scoped to the repos it handles: gittensory, awesome-claude,
// metagraphed); each PR's terminal DISPOSITION is read from the pull_requests cache. (The legacy review_targets
// ledger this used to read was orphaned by the convergence cutover — nothing writes it anymore.)
//
// DISPOSITIONS: merged (merged_at set) / closed (closed without a merge) = the review system auto-actioned;
// commented = still-open reviewed PRs (reviewed + advised, awaiting a maintainer / CI). Reviewed PRs that never
// got a published surface (skipped drafts/bots, errors) simply don't appear — there is no ignored/manual/error.
//   reviewed   = merged + closed + commented            (every distinct PR a review surface was published for)
//   filteredPct = (reviewed - merged) / reviewed         (share resolved WITHOUT a merge — noise kept off humans)
//   accuracyPct = 1 - reversed / (merged + closed)       (reversed = engine auto-actions a human overturned, live)
//   minutesSaved = SUM(per-PR COALESCE(reviewEffortMinutes, MINUTES_SAVED_PER_PR))  (estimated maintainer
//                                                          review time saved -- #1955/#2070: each distinct
//                                                          published PR contributes its persisted estimate,
//                                                          with MINUTES_SAVED_PER_PR only backstopping PRs
//                                                          that lack a stored estimate)
//
// PRIVACY: counts only — no PR content, authors, scores, or reward internals. Safe to serve publicly.
//
// GLOBAL: the homepage total folds in every REGISTERED Orb installation's outcomes (getOrbGlobalStats) on top of
// the own-ledger side, so the counter reflects the whole fleet, not just gittensory's own repos. The own-ledger
// side (audit_events) is a FROZEN snapshot as of the self-host cutover -- it stops growing the day each repo's
// live processing moved off this worker, and can never grow again now that the old App has been fully deleted --
// while orb_pr_outcomes keeps growing in realtime for any repo with the central Orb App installed (including
// JSONbored's own, which still runs the Orb App for telemetry alongside its self-hosted review engine). The two
// sources overlap by (repo, pr_number), not just by account: earlier reasoning here called that overlap "a small,
// bounded double-count," but it was measured directly (2026-07-12) at 243 PRs (173 merged + 70 closed, 96% in one
// repo) -- large enough to move accuracyPct and mislead visitors, not a rounding error. getOrbGlobalStats now
// excludes exactly those overlapping (repo, pr_number) pairs via a NOT EXISTS anti-join against the same
// `github_app.pr_public_surface_published` audit events this file's own disposition query reads, so the two sums
// are over disjoint PR sets and can be added directly.
