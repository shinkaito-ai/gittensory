// Unified PR review comment renderer (convergence — see docs/LOOPOVER_REVIEW_UNIFIED_COMMENT.md).
//
// Produces ONE in-place comment in the loopover SHAPE (colored alert sidebar + readiness
// signal table + collapsibles + re-run + earning footer) with reviewbot's deep review folded
// in (the verdict, the synthesized summary, a "Code review" signal row, nits/blockers), deduped.
//
// ADDITIVE + DORMANT: the live Worker keeps composeUnifiedReview() (advisory-render.ts). This
// renderer is exposed via engine.ts for the host (the loopover app) to call at cutover — it is
// a PURE function (no I/O, no redaction). The host applies its public-safe redaction AFTER, the
// same way the runtime does today (makePublicRedactor / redactOutsideCodeFences).
//
// The host provides loopover's readiness signals + footer + collapsibles in UnifiedCommentContext;
// reviewbot's review data comes in UnifiedReviewInput. The whole comment recolors by one unified
// status so there is a single authoritative verdict, never two.
//
// SELF-CONTAINED NATIVE PORT (reviewbot→loopover convergence): every type + helper this module
// needs is defined HERE. No imports from reviewbot. The logic is byte-faithful to the reviewbot
// source (src/core/unified-comment-render.ts + src/core/advisory-render.ts); the only deltas are
// mechanical guards for loopover's stricter tsconfig (noUncheckedIndexedAccess +
// exactOptionalPropertyTypes), which do not change behavior.
