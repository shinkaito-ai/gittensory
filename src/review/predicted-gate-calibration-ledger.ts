// Login-keyed predict-gate-vs-live-gate calibration ledger (#4517, maintainer review-stack x AMS integration
// audit 2026-07-09) -- the review stack's OWN tamper-resistant calibration ground truth: one durable row per
// (login, real decision) pairing a contributor's self-reported MCP predict_gate verdict against the REAL gate
// decision their PR actually received.
//
// WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM #4516's predicted_gate_calls / computePredictedGateAgreement: that pair answers an
// AGGREGATE, project-level question ("how often does prediction agree with reality"), computed FRESH on every
// read, with no per-login row ever persisted. This ledger persists ONE row per pairing so a FUTURE consumer
// (#2349's personalized gate-prediction confidence tuning) has durable per-actor history to read, without
// re-deriving the join every time.
//
// THE CRITICAL PROPERTY -- READ BEFORE ADDING A CONSUMER OR CALL SITE: this is written EXCLUSIVELY from the
// webhook-driven real-gate-decision path (the same call sites as recordContributorGateDecision in
// src/review/contributor-calibration.ts), and NEVER from any MCP tool or other contributor-reachable surface.
// Both `predicted_action` (read from predicted_gate_calls, itself only ever written by the MCP tool's own
// SERVER-SIDE code, never by a caller-supplied value) and `real_decision` (the queue processor's own computed
// gate action) are values this module has no path for a caller to override or spoof. A miner-writable version
// of this exact data would itself be an anti-farming vector (#2350) -- see contributor-calibration.ts's
// identical design note for the same rationale applied to the plain (non-predicted) side of this ledger.
//
// IMMUTABLE PER (login, project, pr, commit): the row id is deterministic and the insert uses
// `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` (never DO UPDATE) -- a webhook replay at the SAME commit is a no-op, never a
// silent overwrite of the originally-recorded pairing. This is a stronger guarantee than
// recordContributorGateDecision's own per-commit REPLACE semantics, deliberately: once this ledger records a
// prediction-vs-outcome pairing, that pairing must never change underneath a future calibration reader.
//
// READ SIDE (#2349): computeContributorCalibration aggregates ONE login's full history into a plain
// {sampleSize, agreementRate} signal for buildPredictedGateVerdict's personalization input
// (packages/gittensory-engine/src/signals/contributor-calibration.ts). It is intentionally NOT gated by
// isSelfHostedReviewRuntime/isParityAuditEnabled the way the writer above is: the write-side flag controls
// whether this telemetry class is collected at all, but the read is a plain "use whatever rows already
// exist" query -- gating it too would make historical calibration data silently stop being read the moment
// the flag is toggled off, which is a surprising extra restriction nothing here asks for. When the flag was
// never on, the table is simply empty and the read naturally degrades to cold-start.
