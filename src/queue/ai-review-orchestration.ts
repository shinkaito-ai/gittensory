//
// The pieces here were not fully contiguous in the original file -- shouldStartAiReviewForAdvisory /
// shouldRequirePublicAiReviewForAdvisory / resolveReviewManifestForAiReview / resolveReviewEnrichmentGithubToken
// were interspersed with unrelated auto-review-skip / visual-capture helpers that stay in processors.ts -- but
// all four feed directly into runAiReviewForAdvisory below and have no caller besides processors.ts's own
// disposition/publish call sites, so they group cleanly here. A pre-existing misplaced doc comment ("Run the
// opt-in AI maintainer review...", originally floating above shouldStartAiReviewForAdvisory in the source file
// despite describing runAiReviewForAdvisory) is relocated to sit above the function it actually describes,
// since both are moving to this same file anyway. splitRepoForRag (a trivial repoFullName-split helper, was
// the last function in processors.ts) moves here too -- its only two callers are elsewhere in processors.ts
// (staying) and this file's own runAiReviewForAdvisory, so processors.ts imports it back rather than this
// file importing it from processors.ts, keeping the dependency one-directional.

// namespace, not the shared pr-actuation-lock above: this guards an expensive read-and-cache (dedup a redundant

// defect / inconclusive / lock-contention placeholder) that the durable cache (see #1 above) correctly never
// stores as a reusable result, and (2) a dynamic-context repo (grounding/RAG/enrichment/reputation), which
// previously bypassed the cache unconditionally on every single call. Root-caused in production: a single PR
// with RAG enabled generated 259 of 281 AI review calls in 24h via (2) at an UNCHANGED head, plus another 24 via
// (1) — 281 calls total, ~1 every 5 minutes, forever, with nothing ever throttling the retry. This bounds that
// retry cadence without ever treating either outcome as a durable, indefinitely-trustworthy result — it still
// expires and retries periodically (the LLM's own non-determinism may resolve a dispute; dynamic external
// context may genuinely have drifted), and any REAL state change (a new head, a changed review-input
// fingerprint) bypasses this bound immediately regardless of age. Matches AI_REVIEW_LOCK_TTL_SECONDS's
